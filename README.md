## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript / jQuery
- HTML5/CSS3
- Bootrstrap 

I chose jQuery because the app implementation is not very complicated and it's not neccesary to use a js library or framework which adds extra overhead.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: 

Name | Reason
--- | ---
[html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) | For converting the grid in a canvas format, which will help export the grid as an image.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Simple RWD framework for designing the front end and making the application more user friendly.
[file-saver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js#readme) | Was used as the solution to save files on the client-side.
